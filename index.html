    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      My background is in Business and Operations Management. I have worked in
      the corporate and SME environments for just under 5 years now and have
      worked on critical tech transformation projects. I have developed a
      passion for technology most recently, a passion that drove me to learn
      full stack development through the School of Code. I have a deep
      understanding of full stack development, a desire to deliver delightful
      user experiences, and the ability balance tech-capability and UX, to
      satisfy business needs. Thereâ€™s only one thing that motivates me: the
      opportunity to make sure that an organisation is able to get the best out
      of their tech. Whether you are building new solutions or improving old
      ones, I can add value to your tech teams.

      <li>
        <strong>Photography</strong>
        <p>
          Capturing a moment as it happens and creating a moment/scene are the
          two challenges within photography that I enjoy. I love using homemade
          light modifiers when taking portraits. My profile photo is a
          self-portrait, taken using my phone and two led ligts.
